Egyptian Elections Scripts
==========================

Some scripts I used to do stuff while the presidential elections took place in Egypt

You need to have installed xlrd python library before executing this script

The script assumes you are using MySQL. Soon I will look into adding other databases and/or NoSQL support.

The script also assumes you have an existing database with the name "egypt_elections"

Feel free to fork and add features.
